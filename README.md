## Usage

-   Simplest use, give items from the command:
        ``/rgive <player> <limit> <item 1 id> <item 2 id...>``
-   You can create a kit to make it simpler:
        ``/rkitadd <name> <item 1 id> <item 2 id...>``
-   And give that kit:
        ``/rkit <player> <kit name> <limit>``
-   To remove a kit use this command:
        ``/rkitremove <kit name>``
 
 Kits are located in the config.
